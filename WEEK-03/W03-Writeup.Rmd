This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r,mychunk-1,message=FALSE}
library(devtools); # devtools is required for function source_url() to work
my.source = 'github';
github.path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataChris24/WSU_STATS419_FALL2020/";
source_url( paste0(github.path,"master/functions/libraries.R") );
source_url( paste0(github.path,"master/functions/functions-imdb.R") );
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
